## Installation

Install the entire toolkit with [Composer][]:

```shell
composer require salient/toolkit
```

Or install only the components you need, e.g. [salient/cache][],
[salient/utils][] and the toolkit's [PHPStan extension][salient/phpstan]:

```shell
composer require salient/cache salient/utils
composer require --dev salient/phpstan
```

> `salient/toolkit` must be removed from your project before individual
> components can be installed, and the version constraint applied to `salient`
> packages in your `composer.json` must allow the same version of every package
> to be installed.

## Components

The Salient toolkit includes the following components, each of which has its own
[Composer package][packages] and can be installed separately:

> Components in dashed boxes should only be installed as development
> dependencies.

## Documentation

[API documentation][api-docs] for `salient/toolkit` tracks the `main` branch of
the project's [GitHub repository][repo] and is generated by [ApiGen][].

You can build it yourself by running the following commands in the top-level
directory. Output is generated in `docs/api` by default.

```shell
composer -d tools/apigen install
tools/apigen/vendor/bin/apigen -c tools/apigen/apigen.neon
```

Other documentation is available under [docs][], and usage examples are provided
in the form of [unit tests][tests].
